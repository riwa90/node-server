# express.js server

This node.js server was built by me as part of a group project in course II1302, in KTH's BSc programme in Computer Engineering. This project was done with fellow students Richard Farschi Alvarez, William Stacken√§s and Daniel Westerlund. 

The course was a mock agile project, with everything from requirement engineering with a project owner(my role), sprint planning meetings, development, testing, integration and then deployment. I was both product owner and responsible for developing the server that was deployed in the ibm cloud. The server served a vanilla JS webpage, handled authentication, communicated with a relational database microservice in the cloud, and exposed a HTTP api to fetch/modify the database. The webpage and an IoT device communicated with the database via this server.

The server is written in node.js using express.js framework. The tests are written in jest. Most of the code in this repository is written by me, altough some files of others work are left in as placeholders.

Unfortunately there is currently no version of this code running anywhere, and enough files have been deleted to remove others work that it is not runnable.
